# NonFungibleScience

Tamper-proof system for scientific data that stores an unfalsifiable signature of a scientific experiment (a token including a hash of dataset + metadata characterizing the scientific equipment, experiment, documentation address/reference and context) in a blockchain. 

This Non Fungible Token stored in the blockchain can then be used to authenticate the original experiment, authors, device used and datasets and certify that it is the original, not a modified copy.
