# NonFungibleScience
Tamper-proof system for scientific data that stores an unfalsifiable signature of a scientific experiment (hash of data + metadata characterizing the scientific equipment, experiment, documentation address/reference and context) in the blockchain. This Non Fungible Token stored in the blockchain can then be used to authenticate the original experiment, authors, device used and datasets and certify that it is the original, not a modified copy.
